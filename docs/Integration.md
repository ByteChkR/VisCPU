# VisCPU Integration

To integrate the CPU into C# Code there are multiple interfaces that can be utilized to accomplish Interopabilty.


## Integration Helper Library
Straight forward, allows for HL to C# interopabilty and limited C# to HL interopabilty.

Setup:

1. Set the App Root with the `AppRootHelper` class.
2. Prepare Temp Paths.
3. (Optional) Enable Event Logging and Crashing with the `EventManager` class.
4. (Optional) Enable Logging by subscribing to the `Logger.OnLogReceive` event.
5. Build the CPU Instance:
```cs
CpuInstanceBuilder builder = new CpuInstanceBuilder()
								.WithPeripherals(
										new ConsoleOutInterface(),
										...
									)
								.WithExposedApi(SleepTime, "Sleep", 1);
```
The Instance Builder follows the Factory Pattern.
A new CPU Instance can be built by calling `builder.Build()` after all peripherals were set up.

6. Compile a Script with the `CompilerHelper.Compile` method.
```cs
string resultFile = CompilerHelper.Compile(
                TempFile, //Input File
                TempBuild, //Build Output Directory
                TempInternalBuild, //Temporary Build Directory, Used for intermediate results.
                false,                     //Does not clean temp files, useful for debugging
                new[] { "HL-expr", "bin" } //Build Steps, last step has to be "bin" to generate .vbin binary
            );
```
7. Load and Run the Compiled Binary:
```cs
Cpu instance = builder.Build(); //Create CPU Instance

//Load Compiled Binary from File
uint[] binary = File.ReadAllBytes( file ).ToUInt();

//Write to CPU Memory Bus
instance.LoadBinary( binary );

//Run the Compiled Binary
instance.Run();
```

## Integration Helper Library with Dynamic Language Runtime
To make use of the DLR Support, reference `VisCPU.Dynamic`.
Follow the Integration Helper Library Setup until step 6.
Then prepare the CPU Instance and Create a Dynamic Wrapper.
Allows for simple and effortless access to functions and variables in compiled binaries.

___

Note: Make sure that the flag `-linker:export` is set. The Debug Symbols are needed in order to find the correct data in the binary.

Note: All functions have a return value by default. If a function is not returning explicitly, the returned value is undefined

```cs
Cpu instance = builder.Build(); //Create CPU Instance

//Load Compiled Binary from File
uint[] binary = File.ReadAllBytes( file ).ToUInt();

//Write to CPU Memory Bus
instance.LoadBinary( binary );

//Instance Setup Finished

dynamic wrapper = new DynamicCpuWrapper( instance ); //Create Dynamic Wrapper

//Call Entry Point of Loaded Binary
wrapper(); //Invoke directly

//Call Function inside the Binary(has to be public)
uint funcReturn = wrapper.MyFunction();

//Call Function with argument
uint funcArgReturn = wrapper.MyArgFunction(1337);

//Access and set Variable inside the Binary
uint myVariable = wrapper.MyVariable;
wrapper.MyVariable = 100;

```
